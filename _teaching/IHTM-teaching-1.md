excerpt: "This lecture examines the evidence on how social determinants of health influence tuberculosis risk, progression, and treatment outcomes, and considers their integration into global TB control policy."
---
This lecture provides an overview of the social determinants of tuberculosis and their role in the global epidemic. Social determinants of health are the social, economic, and environmental conditions that influence health outcomes, including risk of tuberculosis infection, disease progression, and access to care.

It reviews the evidence on how social determinants affect the progression from TB infection to active disease and from disease onset to cure. The lecture also summarizes developments in TB control policy, highlighting how poverty reduction and action on social determinants have been integrated into the World Health Organizationâ€™s Global TB Strategy.
