excerpt: "This session introduces validity and bias, asking whether a study truly measures what it intends to, and whether its findings can be trusted and applied beyond the study context."

Evaluation research aims to draw meaningful, trustworthy conclusions from data to inform policies and programs. Validity refers to the extent to which research accurately measures what it intends to measure. Errors in research can be systematic, producing bias that consistently distorts findings (e.g., selection, information, or confounding bias), or random, arising from chance variation such as sampling error or measurement imprecision. These two types of error have distinct consequences for interpretation.

This lecture highlights the importance of planning studies carefully, analysing data thoroughly, and interpreting results thoughtfully to ensure accurate and trustworthy conclusions. Drawing on Shadish, Cook, and Campbell, it explores four key types of validity, statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, and external validity, and examines common sources of both random and systematic error, including insufficient statistical power, selection effects, confounding, measurement error, and overgeneralisation.

Through real-world examples, the lecture illustrates how these issues can arise at different stages of the research process, from study design and data collection to analysis and interpretation. It also highlights practical strategies to identify and mitigate these threats, strengthening the credibility and reliability of evaluation findings.
