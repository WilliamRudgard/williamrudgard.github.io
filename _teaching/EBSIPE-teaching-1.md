This lecture explores issues of validity and bias, focusing on whether a study accurately measures its intended concepts and whether its conclusions are credible and applicable beyond the specific study context."
background: "Evaluation research involves drawing meaningful conclusions from data to ensure findings are reliable and useful for shaping policies and programs. Although most studies focus on specific local settings, their results often aim to address broader questions and challenges. This lecture highlights the importance of planning studies carefully, analysing data thoroughly, and interpreting results thoughtfully to ensure accurate and trustworthy conclusions.

Students will learn about four key types of validity – statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, and external validity – and how these concepts help researchers avoid mistakes and improve the quality of their work. Students will explore potential threats that can undermine each of the four forms of validity, including issues such as insufficient statistical power, selection effects, confounding, and overgeneralisation.

Using real-world examples, students will see how these issues can arise at different stages of the research process, from study design and data collection to analysis and interpretation. They will also learn practical ways to identify these problems and improve the overall strength and reliability of their evaluations.
