title: "Quantifying child climate risk and resilience across Africa"
excerpt: >
  Climate change poses a growing threat to the wellbeing of millions of children, adolescents, and young people worldwide, while deepening inequalities in exposure, vulnerability, and future opportunity. In a context of constrained resources, a central challenge for governments and partners is how to prioritise interventions to protect children facing overlapping climate and development risks before these translate into lasting losses in health, learning, and future livelihoods.<br><br>
  This research addresses this challenge by identifying where climate hazards intersect with child population density and multiple deprivations. It integrates nationally representative child development surveys (MICS and DHS) with gridded population counts (WorldPop) and satellite-derived climate observations through Google Earth Engine to generate subnational estimates of children exposed to floods, droughts, and heatwaves, and to map overlapping vulnerabilities, including poor nutrition, lack of access to improved water and sanitation, and low immunisation coverage. By clarifying where risks are most concentrated, the work supports more targeted and informed decisions about the allocation of limited resources.
