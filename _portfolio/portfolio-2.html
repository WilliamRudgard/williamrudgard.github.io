title: "Modelling the short- and long-term impacts of adolescent social interventions across Africa"
excerpt: |
This research addresses the fundamental question of how upstream interventions capable of generating multiple, cross-sectoral impacts across health, education, and future economic opportunities can be financed and scaled sustainably within real-world systems and delivery contexts. It approaches this question by assessing the value for money of bundled intervention packages that simultaneously strengthen the capabilities of children and adolescents while reshaping the systems that shape their life trajectories.

The analysis is conducted through the simulation of expected human development impacts at scale, informed by high-quality impact evaluations, alongside the estimation of resulting economic returns and monetised health benefits. This work is carried out in collaboration with governments, donors, international organisations, and community-based organisations, and is designed to inform policy design, programme prioritisation, and sustainable financing decisions. These intervention bundles combine direct engagement with children and adolescents with efforts to remove barriers to services, improve service quality, and engage families, communities, and other key gatekeepers who influence children’s and adolescents’ opportunities and choices.

The work is highly quantitative, drawing on social and medical statistical methods, econometric analysis, cost modelling, and mathematical simulation.
